This is going to be the   FIRST COMMIT ---- 1

Whatever I have suggested is in favor of the nation and not for for any individuals party favor.
What we all have observed that in last 4 years of BJP has done nothing for Nation Infrastructure buildup.

Just BJP is trying to fool yongsters by doing Media Management and rying to creates a fear among the students
whoever will try to protect his own rights.

Major problem is that he is completely against the Dmocracy and present Constitution. This thought is very dangerous 
towards the future of the country.

A few suggestions to Congress....

1) Whatever Navy is commissioned his warship in last 2 , 3 years are certainly not a Narendra Modi Vision and his leadership. All this started building under Congree Leadership and vision. Now it takes much time to get completed but Narendra Modi is trying to take credit of all navy warships commissioned into sea.  Congress should point out all these this to maximum level to the country my means of media , electronic media or by help of news channel or doing rally at different places.  Narendra Modi says that ALL Defense warships are his vision. But as per observation he did nothing favor  for country rather than he brings captilasim from America. 

2)  Manmohan Singh Government has started Mountain division Core to combat China. What happen to that Modi Government has scrapped this. We have to explain that in reality Modi is doing nothig to this nation. Whatever Modi is inaugurating is  the achivmenet of Congress. Very recently on 17th Nov 2016 AAJTAK News channel has shows that Narendra Modi Government has given  more than 1000 acres of land of defense to his close business man. Also almost 1500 acre of lands of railways was given to private firms. I dont's have more details but AAJTAK news has shown this on 17th Nov 2016 around 8.30 PM eveing. We can elaborate this and we can prove to the public.

3) I have genuine reason to prove that Narendra Modi is a Agent of America. Even Narendra Modi can not deny this that he is not a agent of America. But to accept this Narendra Modi needs to have self respect which anyhow he don't have.  As he claims that he is son of tea seller and usually he sold teas at railway station and inside trains. First of all we should that between 1990 and 2000 how many times he travelled to US , New York. I heard somewhere that USA , New York was his second home during 1990 - 2000. So million dollar question is that how a tea seller's son  can travel to USA many many times. I don't have exact figure but he travelled many times. Congress can put all these data in front of country people that how much lies narendra Modi can spaek. Narendra Modi was a Business Man and still a Business Man If we able to prove this to general public his potential will be left with half so that BJP Potential. Only Narendra Modi is a Mass Leader in BJP so we have to prove the real points for Modi and wish to do for Business for Gujrat. Narendra Modi should understand that Gujrat is not the only state in India but even many other states to look for. Like he visits Eastern Indian states during election only and why ?

4 ) What our PM did to railways , a flexi fare .....why he want that no one from general public can use premium trains.
    Earlier fare was cheaper and even general public was easily using Rajdhani , Shatabdi , Duronto etc. But introducing flexi fares cost becomes almost doubles     and now this is very difficult for general public to use premium trains.  Railway fares increased 4 times in last 2 and half years but there is no improvment in facility and no improvemnt at all. To solve his own businessness man friend he is declaring  Bullet train between Gujrat and Mumbai. But cost will be much highrer than benefits we will get by Bullet Train. Also to benefit his bussinessman in Foregin he try to implement TALGO bogies is not compatible for indian population. As TALGO Boggy is made of alumunium which will have worst and maximum damage if any accidents happen. But to make profit of his foreign business man he is trying to have a deal with TALGO on cost of security of public of India.

5) This Currency Ban is a Economic EMERGENCY WAS FORCED on this nation. This is a very big scam and have to prove this to nation. If possible demand for CAG Auditing.

6) Narendra Modi Governemnt has halfed the Education subsidy what Congress Government was giving earlier. We have to prove that those Subcidies given is for general and poor public of the country. He has triple the fees of IIT's like institution. This is a curse decision for indian Public. If any student of the country is doing excellent and reaching to IITs then government could have rewarded by less fees of such institutions. But here fee is tripled which will force poor to go for loan and get trapped by Bank otherwise force to quit the dream of IITs and such institution. This is implemented with many other institutions which fees are doubled tripled.
 What Narendra Modi has pleasure to cut the subsidies of education. Where all these money going on ? Is that much of money is going for to pay for bussiness mans loans  and where ?.. In every department he has less down the subsidies and where all these much of money going on.... All this is a big scam and may be the largest scam in World. This is the first time in history of India that PM is returing loan ammount to his close bussiness man from the money of public.

7) He very much amount less down and cut the subsidies of MANAREGA. Where that amount went ?  How many new institutions opened by Government of India ? Every IITs and    IIMs to every state was a plan of congress to help then educate a general public. 

8) How many reserach and development insitututes founded by him ? Like ISRO and DRDO and many other fundamental institutions are planned and Implemented by Congress Governemnt. Also we have to prove our Glorious pat and achievements done in favor of nation. Like Software / IT firms are bring by Late Rajeev Gandhi also Navodaya Vidyalaya was bring by Visionary Leader Late Rajeev Gandhi. We all Congress have to bring our achievments to public. Like Aadhaar card to stop Corruption was done by Congress.
